# Regulatory Affairs of Road Accident Data 2020 India

## 🚗 Project Overview
This project analyzes road accident data from 50 cities in India for the year 2020. The dataset includes details about accident counts, causes, and trends, helping to identify patterns and propose safety improvements. Using data analysis and visualization techniques, we extract meaningful insights that can guide policy decisions and road safety measures.
